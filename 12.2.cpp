/*
Writea C++ to implement the following using the concept of inheritance:-
    1) Create data member roll_no,
    reg_no 
    and member function get_number (to take input and put_number() to display in the base class STUDENT.
    2) The class Test contains a data member part1 and part2. Redefine the above two functions.
    3) The class SCORE contains a member score.Redefine get_number and put_number().
    4) Redefine display function in RESULT class as well to calculate total, where
        TOTAL = part1 + part2 + score.

Note : Implement the concept of run-time polymorphism,and include constructors in all the classes.
